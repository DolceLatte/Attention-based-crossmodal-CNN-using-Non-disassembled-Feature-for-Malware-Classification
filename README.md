Implementation of crossmodal CNN (using Pytorch)

## Abstract
<p>Malware is threatening cybersecurity. In order to handle malware, it is necessary to be able to identify the behavior of different types of malwares. To this end, studies are being conducted to classify malware into families and detect malware based on deep learning. Especially, to classify malware into families is important in grasping the behavior among malware family. For classify malware, Most of studies extract features by disassembling malware. However, the cost of disassembly is very high. Recent studies efficiently classify malware into families without disassembly based on images or entropy that improves these shortcomings. In this paper, we propose an image and entropy-based cross-modal convolutional neural network for classifying malware into families without disassemble processing. The proposed model effectively combines the two modalities based on the attention mechanism to complement the shortcomings present in image and entropy information. The proposed model achieves comparable accuracy and classifies malware into families with higher accuracy than when using only one modality.</p>
