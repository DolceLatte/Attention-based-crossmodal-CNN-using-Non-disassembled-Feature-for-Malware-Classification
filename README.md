## Abstract
<p>
A notorious type of malware is metamorphic malware, which can change its code and patterns. Multiple copies of the same origins typically hinder malware detection by delaying malware analysts from identifying the signature patterns of malware. Recent studies on malware classification have begun to gain interest, enabling the differentiation of instances in different families while being resilient to the variance of instances of the same family. Some methods are known to yield meaningful performance in classifying malware families. However, their high performance is owed to the disassembled malware they use, whereas disassembling obfuscated malware requires places a huge burden on analysts; analyzing within an acceptable time frame is sometimes impossible. This study proposes a new deep learning-based malware classification method for detecting malware families with the same origins. To overcome the limitations of previous methods, our proposed method is based on non-disassembled malware. Despite this, we achieve as good a performance as previous methods without disassembled data using a cross-modal convolutional neural network with the combined features of "malware images" and "structural entropies." To benefit from the advantages of both multi-modalities as much as possible, we devise a sophisticated attention mechanism that can effectively moderate the noises from each feature. The results show that our model classifies malware families with a higher accuracy than previous methods, but does not require the burden of disassembling.
